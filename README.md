# Assignment 21: React Google Books Search

## Overview

In this assignment, I created a full-stack Google Bâ—Šooks search app with React. The assignment required me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

```
AS a user who is an avid reader, 
I WANT to be able to search for books to read, 
SO THAT I can expand my knowledge
```
- - -

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am a user who is an avid reader, 
WHEN I search for a book,
THEN I am presented with a list of books.

WHEN I click on the save button,
THEN I the book is added to my list of saved books.

WHEN I click on the "Saved" tab,
THEN I am presented with a list of saved books.

WHEN I click on a book,
THEN I am presented with the title, the author, an image, and a brief summary of the book.

WHEN I click on the "delete" button,
THEN I the book is deleted from the list.

```
